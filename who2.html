<p>


Between doctor appointments, IEP meetings and therapy visits raising a child with special needs can feel overwhelming. Taking a moment to set aside time to plan for your child’s future, is without question hard to do. Thinking of the day-to-day stuff that needs to happen is hard enough. Leave alone the planning that needs to be in place to secure your child’s future and start coordinating with the plans about your own retirement.
<br /></p>
<p>
We get it. Having a plan though can help you achieve peace of mind that your child will be taken care of, even when you cannot.
<br />
</p>
<p>


We can help you develop a plan to ensure your child has the resources to reach his or her potential in society and maintain the appropriate level of independence. We’ll help you sort through various aspects of planning that should integrate life planning, resource planning, finance and legal planning and help you assemble a team of experts that can address all of these key areas. Perhaps most important we’ll help you ensure that a backup plan is in place even when the team may no longer be around.</p>

<p>

We help you  look at:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disk">


<li> An estimate of lifetime financial support your child will need.</li><p>

</p>
<p>

</p><li>A Letter of Intent that guides members of the family, friends of family and members of a Circle of Support, who will need to take over for parents when the need arises to address social life, employment, and residential needs.
</li>
<p>

</p><li>Document a Circle of Support of key individuals and what each does for your child such as family members, friends, a life coach, behavioral counselors, etc. and a transition plan to keep this all in place when you may not be able to.
</li>
<p>

</p><li>Help you coordinate legal and estate planning which includes Special Needs Trusts and government benefit eligibility.
</li>
<p>

</p><li>  Assemble the right team of experts to ensure you’re doing the best you possibly can for securing your family’s future.</li>
<p>

</p></ul>
